# 🚀 START HERE

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

Your voice-first marketplace with **Sonora AI agent** is built and cleaned up.

---

## 📝 What You Need to Do:

### 1. Add API Keys to `.env`

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### 2. Get Your Keys

**ElevenLabs:** (for voice)
- Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
- Create API Key named "Sonora"
- Enable: **Text to Speech** + **Speech to Text**
- Copy and paste in `.env`

**Gemini:** (for AI brain)
- Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Create API Key
- Copy and paste in `.env`

---

## 🎯 Test Sonora

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click big **"Talk to Sonora"** button
3. Hold the mic button and say: **"Show me the marketplace"**
4. Watch Sonora navigate automatically and speak!

---

## 💬 What to Say to Sonora

Try these commands:
- "Show me the marketplace"
- "Find me a hoodie under $35"
- "Add to cart"
- "Checkout"
- "I want to create a store"

---

## 🎤 How It Works

1. **User holds button** → Speaks command
2. **ElevenLabs STT** → Transcribes voice to text
3. **Gemini AI** → Understands intent (search/buy/navigate)
4. **Sonora executes** → Searches products, adds to cart, navigates
5. **ElevenLabs TTS** → Speaks confirmation
6. **User hears response** → Completely hands-free!

---

## 🏆 For Demo/Presentation

### Key Points:
- **"Sonora is an AI agent users talk to for everything"**
- **"No clicking, no typing—just conversation"**
- **"Built for people with disabilities who can't use traditional e-commerce"**
- **"11M+ blind Americans can't easily shop online—Sonora solves this"**

### Demo Script:
1. Show landing page → Click "Talk to Sonora"
2. Say: "Show me the marketplace" → Sonora navigates
3. Say: "Find me headphones under $100" → Sonora searches
4. Say: "Add to cart" → Sonora adds product
5. Say: "Checkout" → Complete purchase by voice
