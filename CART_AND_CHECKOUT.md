# ðŸ›’ Cart & Checkout System

## âœ… What I Built:

### 1. **Cart Page** (`/cart`)
- View all items in cart
- Adjust quantities (+/-)
- Remove items
- See total price
- Proceed to checkout

### 2. **Checkout Page** (`/checkout`)
- Secure payment form
- Pre-filled test card credentials
- Order summary
- Fake Stripe integration

### 3. **Success Page** (`/checkout/success`)
- Confirmation message
- Order total
- Order number
- Links to continue shopping

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

### Adding to Cart (Voice):
1. Say: **"Find me a mechanical keyboard"**
2. Sonora finds it and describes it
3. Say: **"Add it to cart"** or **"Yes, add to cart"**
4. Item saved to `localStorage`

### Viewing Cart:
- Say: **"Show me my cart"** or **"View cart"**
- Or click cart button in navigation
- Navigate to `/cart`

### Checkout Flow:
1. From cart â†’ Click "Proceed to Checkout"
2. Fill in details (or use pre-filled test data)
3. Click "Pay"
4. Success page shows confirmation

## ðŸŽ¤ Voice Shopping Flow:

```
User: "Find me headphones under $100"
Sonora: "I found 3 products..."
User: "Add the first one to cart"
Sonora: "Added Premium Wireless Headphones to your cart"
User: "Show me my cart"

## ðŸš€ Future: Real Stripe Integration

When ready for production:

1. Replace fake payment with real Stripe
2. Add `/api/checkout/create-session` endpoint
3. Use Stripe Elements for card input
4. Handle webhooks for payment confirmation
5. Store orders in database

For now: **All payments are fake for demo purposes!**

## âœ… Ready to Test:

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Say: "Find me a mechanical keyboard"
3. Say: "Add it to cart"
4. Say: "Show me my cart"
5. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
6. Use test card: `0000 0000 0000 0000`
7. Complete payment
