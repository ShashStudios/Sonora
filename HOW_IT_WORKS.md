# 🧠 How Sonora's AI Works

## Architecture Flow:

```
User speaks
    ↓
ElevenLabs STT (transcribe)
    ↓
Gemini AI (understand intent) ← YES, GEMINI IS USED!
    ↓
Custom logic (infer actions from keywords)
    ↓
Execute action (search/navigate/etc)
    ↓
ElevenLabs TTS (speak response)
```

## 🤖 Yes, Gemini IS Being Used!

### What Gemini Does:
1. **Receives** your transcribed text
2. **Gets context** about available products
3. **Generates** a natural conversational response
4. **Returns** friendly text like: "I found 2 headphones under $100..."

### What Custom Logic Does:
After Gemini responds, our code also:
1. **Parses keywords** ("find", "headphones", "under $100")
2. **Searches database** for matching products
3. **Filters by price** if mentioned
4. **Returns results** to enhance Gemini's response

## 📊 Console Logs You'll See:

When you talk to Sonora, watch the console:

```
🧠 ============ GEMINI AI CALL START ============
📝 User message: headphones under $100
🔮 Calling Gemini API...
✅ Gemini Response: Let me find you some great headphones...
🧠 ============ GEMINI AI CALL END ============
🔧 Parsing AI response and inferring action...
📋 Parsed response: I'll search for headphones for you
🎬 Inferred action: {type: 'search_products', query: 'headphones', maxPrice: 100}
🔍 Search results: 3
```

## 🎯 Hybrid Approach:

We use **BOTH**:

### Gemini AI (Conversational):
- Generates friendly responses
- Understands context
- Makes it feel human

### Custom Logic (Functional):
- Extracts search terms
- Filters products
- Executes actions
- Ensures accurate results

---

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Option 1: Only Gemini
❌ Might hallucinate products
❌ Can't guarantee accuracy
❌ Slower

### Option 2: Only Keywords
❌ Feels robotic
❌ Not conversational
❌ Limited understanding

### Option 3: HYBRID (What We Do) ✅
✅ Natural conversation (Gemini)
✅ Accurate results (Our logic)
✅ Fast and reliable
✅ Best of both worlds!

## 🔍 Example Breakdown:

**You say:** "Find me headphones under $100"

1. **ElevenLabs STT** → Transcribes to text
2. **🧠 Gemini** → "I'd be happy to help you find headphones!"
3. **Custom Logic** → Searches DB, finds 3 matches under $100
4. **Final Response** → "I found 3 products. 1. Premium Wireless Headphones for $79.99..."
5. **ElevenLabs TTS** → Speaks the response

## ✅ Summary:

**Gemini IS being used** for:
- Understanding user intent
- Generating natural responses
- Making conversations feel human

**Custom code handles**:
- Actual product searches
- Price filtering
- Navigation
- Cart management

**Together** = Natural voice shopping experience! 🎉
